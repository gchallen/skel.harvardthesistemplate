10 Jul 2010 : GWA : Modified thesis template.

Each chapter directory must include the following:

Assuming your chapter directory name is 1-chapter:

1) A symlink to itself. This allows the chapter to be built as part of the
entire thesis or individually. The symlink name must match the directory
name.

2) 1-chapter.tex: Tex file used to build the chapter alone. You can use the
example included as a guide. Note that this pulls in "../template.chapter"
from the parent directory which can be used to define common bits of the tex
file for all chapters. (I used this to define PDF metadata.)

3) Makefile: symlinked to ../Makefile.chapter, used to build the chapters.

4) hut10.clo, hut11.clo, hut12.clo, huthesis.cls: symlinked to Harvard Thesis
latex class files located in parent directory.

5) include.tex: defines the structure of the chapter. Cleanest is to use only
\input statements here. Since this is used by both the chapter and whole
document build paths are relative to the parent directory. Our self-named
symlink ensures that we stay in the same directory when building the chapter
alone.

6) references.bib: symlinks to the common references bibliography file in the
parent directory.

Optional:

7) figs: figure directory for this chapter.
